# Characterizing-and-Detecting-Non-Consensual-Photo-Sharing-on-Social-Networks

We selected 5013 images from the Flickr30k and the COCO2017 datasets. To get the state of each person in the images, we further segmented each person in the images, resulting in a dataset of 6437 persons. If there are N persons in an image, we made N copies of it, and each copy was pre-processed to draw a rectangular bounding box enclosing one person. We next presented these copies to at least three participants (they were recruited on our campus, and each worker was paid \$10 for an hour) and asked them 'If you were the person in the green box, do you think you were aware or unaware that you were being photographed?'. The class label of a person was determined using the mean score for this question: a positive score was labeled as `aware party', a negative score was labeled as `unaware party', and zero was labeled as `neither'. In this way, we acquired 3764 (58.5\%) persons with the label `unaware party' and 2673 (41.5\%) persons with `aware party'. 6437 persons have split into train and test sets of 4593 (71\%) and 1844 (29\%) persons, respectively.
